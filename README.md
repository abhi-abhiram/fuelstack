## Introduction

A full-stack monorepo starter kit powered by [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org), originally based on Turborepo
[example kitchen-sink](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples/kitchen-sink).

This starter kit is already pre-configured with some additional packages and tools, such as:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) for static type checking
- [Fastify](https://fastify.dev) for the REST or GraphQL API
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for the frontend
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for the styling the frontend
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev) TypeScript library bundler powered by esbuild
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) test runner for all things JavaScript
- <s>[Minio](https://min.io/) for S3 storage backend</s>
- [Garage S3](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr) for S3 storage backend

Each package and app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. Install Node.js `v18.16.1` or greater: https://nodejs.org/en/download
2. Install `pnpm` package manager: https://pnpm.io/installation
3. Docker and Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/desktop

### Setup New Project

```sh
# Using npx
npx create-turbo@latest -e https://github.com/riipandi/fuelstack

# Using yarn
yarn create-turbo@latest -e https://github.com/riipandi/fuelstack

# Using pnpm
pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest -e https://github.com/riipandi/fuelstack
```

### Changing The Organization Scope

The organization scope for this starter is `@acme`. To change this, you'll need to do the following:

- Rename folders in `packages/*` to replace `acme` with your desired scope.
- Search and replace `acme` string with your desired scope.

### Generate Secret Key

Before you continue, you need to create `.env` file (you can duplicate `.env.example`) and
fill the `application secret key` with some random string. To generate a secret key, use
the following command:

```sh
openssl rand -base64 500 | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1
```

### Up and Running

This turborepo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as a package manager.
Run `pnpm install` to install required npm dependencies.

**Start all packages in development**

```sh
pnpm dotenv -e .env.local -- turbo run dev
```

**Run or build partial apps or package**

```sh
# Running the Fastify API in development mode
pnpm dotenv -e .env.local -- turbo run dev --filter=api...

# Running the Next.js application in development mode
pnpm dotenv -e .env.local -- turbo run dev --filter=website...

# Build the Next.js application for production
pnpm dotenv -e .env.local -- turbo run build --filter=website...
```

For more detailed explanation, check out [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/docs/features/scopes) documentation.

Turborepo's team currently [recommend](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/environment-variables)
using `dotenv-cli` as the simplest way to bring your environment variables into your development tasks.
Turborepo's team looking forward to improving the developer experience and ergonomics for your
environment variables in a future release of Turborepo.

### Turborepo Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.org/docs/features/remote-caching)
to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel.
If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```sh
# Authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your Vercel account
pnpm dlx turbo login

# Link your project to your Remote Cache
pnpm dlx turbo link
```

### Useful Commands

This starter contains a command line script to help you manage the project such as running
the PostgreSQL, Redis, and Mailpit on Docker.

```sh
pnpm dev          # Develop all packages and the docs site
pnpm build        # Build all packages and the docs site
pnpm lint         # Lint all packages
pnpm cleanup      # Clean up all node_modules and dist folders
```

## Deploying with Docker

### Build Docker image

```sh
docker build -f apps/website/Dockerfile . --no-cache \
  -t acme-website:$(npm pkg get version | tr -d "\042") \
  -t acme-website:latest
```

If you want to use Turbo caching:

```sh
docker build -f apps/website/Dockerfile . --no-cache \
  --build-arg TURBO_TEAM="your_team_name" \
  --build-arg TURBO_TOKEN="your_token" \
  -t acme-website:$(npm pkg get version | tr -d "\042") \
  -t acme-website:latest
```

### Run Docker image

```sh
docker run --rm -it --name acme-website -p 3000:3000 \
  --env-file .env.docker acme-website:latest
```

For more detailed explanation, check out [Deploying with Docker](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/deploying-with-docker) documentation.

## Deploy your own

You'll want to fork this repository and deploy your own Next.js website. Once you have an
image generator that sparks joy, you can setup [automatic GitHub](https://vercel.com/github)
deployments so that pushing to master will deploy to production! üöÄ

[![Deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)][vercel-deploy]

### Vercel Deployment

You will need to configure a few things:

- Settings -> General -> Root Directory : `apps/website/`
- Settings -> Git -> Ignored Build Step : `git diff --quiet HEAD^ HEAD ./`

Ignored Build Step configuration used to avoid rebuilding on Vercel when pushing the changes.
So, Vercel will deploy only when any changes on the specific directory.

### Cloudflare Deployment

You need to add `NODE_VERSION` with value `18.16.1` on the environment variables setting.

## Thanks to...

In general, I'd like to thank every single one who open-sources their
source code for their effort to contribute something to the open-source
community. Your work means the world! üåç ‚ù§Ô∏è
